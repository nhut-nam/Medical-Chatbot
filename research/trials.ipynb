Identify personnel, facility, record-keeping and supplies require-\\nments needed to implement MA services at their work site\\nEach module in the study guide has three sections: the contents, \\nreview questions and reflection questions.\\nThe modules provide information about MA: recommended \\nregimens, eligibility, clinical care, counseling and information, and \\nservice delivery issues. \\nThe Review section provides questions that focus on key learning \\npoints. Correct answers are listed in the answer key.\\nThe Reflect section is designed to stimulate thinking about what is \\ncurrently in place for MA services and how to apply the contents \\nof the study guide to actual service delivery settings. \\nSecond edition\\nThis study guide was designed to train providers on the delivery \\nof high-quality, clinic-based, first-trimester medical abortion \\n(MA), particularly in limited-resource settings. This second edition \\nhas been updated to reflect the latest evidence from the World \\nHealth Organization (WHO 2012 ) and other important source \\ndocuments.  These updates include current clinical evidence and \\nrecommendations on providing appropriate MA care to young \\nwomen and working with communities to improve information, \\nsocial support and access.\\nThis curriculum focuses on provision of MA by trained health-\\ncare providers working in facilities in the formal health-care \\nsystem. There is increasing attention on making MA information \\nand drugs more widely available to women in real and virtual \\ncommunities outside the formal health system, particularly in \\nsettings where women face serious risks due to lack of access to \\nsafe services. Ipas has policies, materials and programs to support \\nthese efforts. In this second edition, we have included some \\nrecommendations on how to increase access and improve linkages \\nbetween communities and health facilities. For more information \\non this, please see Additional Resources, Community Access.\\nIn this second edition, we address young women’s unique needs in \\nan effort to increase MA service delivery and access. Young women \\nare disproportionately affected by unsafe abortion. Girls aged 10 \\n-19 in developing countries undergo at least 2.2 to 4 million unsafe \\nabortions and account for approximately 45 percent of unsafe \\nabortion-related deaths each year (WHO 2007).  Women under the age \\nof 20 make up 70 percent of all hospitalizations from unsafe abortion \\ncomplications (Plan 2007).  We note where there is evidence for any \\nclinical or other differences for young versus adult women. Where it \\nis relevant, we also note where there is a lack of evidence.

We recommend \\nadministering a pre-test prior to the workshop that covers the \\ninformation included in the MA Study Guide and requiring learners \\nto score 75 percent or higher on this test to participate in the \\nworkshop and practicum. This requirement ensures all trainees have \\na base of requisite knowledge that they apply through skills practice \\nin the in-person training and practicum.\\nLearners who do not have access to mifepristone can skip Module \\n2A, Medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol, and \\ninstead use Module 2B, Medical abortion with misoprostol only. \\nBecause MA using both mifepristone and misoprostol is more \\neffective than misoprostol only, Ipas recommends that MA be \\nprovided with the combination of the two wherever possible. \\nAdditional options for self-guided learning are available at \\nIpasUniversity, which offers free, online, on-demand courses \\nfor reproductive health professionals on safe abortion care and \\npostabortion care.

Although sharp curettage is \\ncommon in many countries, WHO guidelines state that it should \\nbe used only when vacuum aspiration or MA are not available \\n(WHO  2012). A recent statement by the International Federation \\nof Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) supported the use of vacuum \\naspiration or medications over sharp curettage for uterine \\nevacuation (FIGO 2011). Therefore, health-system officials and \\nadministrators should make all possible efforts to replace sharp \\ncurettage with vacuum aspiration or MA. If services are being \\nintroduced for the first time, vacuum aspiration and medical \\nabortion should be introduced rather than sharp curettage.\\nWith vacuum aspiration, the contents of the uterus are evacuated \\nthrough a plastic or metal cannula using suction provided by a \\nhandheld, portable aspirator (manual vacuum aspiration) or by an \\nelectric pump (electric vacuum aspiration). Vacuum aspiration is \\nan important alternative to and occasional back-up for MA.\\nMA, a globally endorsed method, involves the use of various \\nmedicines to evacuate the uterus. WHO stated in 2003 and \\nreiterated in 2012 that “medical methods of abortion have been \\nproved to be safe and effective” (WHO 2003, WHO 2012). In 2005 \\nWHO added mifepristone with misoprostol and misoprostol only \\nto its Model List of Essential Medicines (WHO 2005).

MA \\noffers the following advantages in low-resource settings or in \\ncommunities where access to safe abortion is restricted:\\n• MA services are simple to deliver, easy to manage and the \\nmedications do not require refrigeration. MA may require \\nless equipment, facilities and staffing.\\n• MA may be more accessible than vacuum aspiration because \\nmany provider cadres can be trained to provide MA, and \\nresearch has demonstrated that appropriately trained cadres \\nof providers can administer medical abortion as safely as \\ndoctors in low-resource settings (Warriner, et al 2011). This \\nfacilitates care being provided at the most local level, close \\nto where women live and work. This may particularly benefit \\nyoung women, who are known to have reduced access to safe \\nabortion (Turner 2011).\\n• In many settings, clinicians can provide information on \\ncorrect MA doses and regimens to women even if they are not \\nauthorized to directly dispense the drugs. \\n• In settings where sharp curettage has been the main method \\nof uterine evacuation, MA provides an especially desirable \\nalternative, eliminating the potential need for general \\nanesthesia and a hospital stay.\\n• MA is the safest and perhaps only abortion option available \\nin some clinical situations (Creinin 1996):\\n— When a woman has certain uterine anomalies that \\npreclude the use of MVA or sharp curettage   \\n— When cervical dilation is or would be difficult, such as \\nwith cervical stenosis.\\n• MA may be cost-effective when compared with other \\nmethods.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs \\nwhen a fertilized egg attaches itself outside of the uterus, most \\noften in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy is rare, occurring \\nin less than 1% of women presenting for an abortion (Edwards \\n& Creinin 1997). If an ectopic pregnancy is unrecognized, it can \\ncause potentially life-threatening complications from rupture and \\nhemorrhage. For this reason, ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause \\nof maternal mortality in the first trimester (Khan 2006, WHO 1985). \\nTherefore, providers should maintain a high index of suspicion \\nfor ectopic pregnancy and carefully evaluate women’s risk before \\nproviding medical abortion. Uterine evacuation methods, whether \\nvacuum aspiration or MA using misoprostol with or without \\nmifepristone, will not terminate an ectopic pregnancy. Any woman \\nwith a suspected ectopic pregnancy should be educated about the \\nrisks, including tubal rupture, hemorrhage and death. Ruptured \\nectopic pregnancy occurs more frequently in women who have \\nlimited contact with health-care providers and present late for \\ncare (Obed 2006). Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a gynecologic \\nemergency that requires immediate surgical intervention.\\nSpecial considerations\\nMA with mifepristone and misoprostol may be given to women in \\nthe following categories:\\nYoung women\\nMA is safe and effective in adolescents (Phelps 2001). MA has been \\nshown to be even more effective in women who have not given \\nbirth before (Chien 2009, Le Febvre 2008). MA failure was found \\nto be independently associated with women’s older age, previous \\nspontaneous abortions, multigravidity and earlier follow-up visit \\n(Haimov-Kochman 2007). A Finnish study found that adolescents had \\nfewer incomplete abortions, less need for surgical (re)evacuation, \\nfewer hemorrhages and fewer complications than non-adolescents \\nhaving surgical and medical abortion (Niinimäki 2011).\\nAsthma\\nWomen using asthma inhalers including inhaled corticosteroids \\nmay have MA, because the medications in asthma inhalers are \\nnot systemically absorbed. Although some prostaglandins are \\nvasoconstrictors, misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that \\npromotes bronchodilation, decreases inflammation and increases \\noxygen flow (Bernstein & Kandinow 2004).\\nHIV and AIDS\\nWomen living with HIV and AIDS may use MA.'),\n",

Although no harmful effects have been \\nfound in infants after maternal misoprostol ingestion, women who \\nare concerned may nurse immediately before taking medications \\nor wait four to five hours after their last dose of medication (Vogel \\n2004, Abdel-Aleem 2003, Saav 2010).\\nSexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)\\nIf a woman is found to have an STI at the time she requests MA, \\nthe STI treatment may be started on the same day she receives \\nmifepristone (Davis & Easterling 2009, Achilles & Reeves 2011). \\nObesity\\nThere is no difference in efficacy with mifepristone and \\nmisoprostol among obese women compared to non-obese women \\n(Strafford 2009). Thus, no dose adjustment for mifepristone or \\nmisoprostol is required. \\nMultiple gestation\\nA woman who is pregnant with twins (or other multiple \\ngestations) may take mifepristone and misoprostol using the \\nstandard dosages of medications.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs \\nwhen a fertilized egg attaches itself outside of the uterus, most \\noften in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy is rare, occurring \\nin less than 1% of women presenting for an abortion (Edwards \\n& Creinin 1997). If an ectopic pregnancy is unrecognized, it can \\ncause potentially life-threatening complications from rupture and \\nhemorrhage. For this reason, ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause \\nof maternal mortality in the first trimester (Khan 2006, WHO 1985). \\nTherefore, providers should maintain a high index of suspicion \\nfor ectopic pregnancy and carefully evaluate women’s risk before \\nproviding medical abortion. Uterine evacuation methods, whether \\nvacuum aspiration or MA using misoprostol with or without \\nmifepristone, will not terminate an ectopic pregnancy. Any woman \\nwith a suspected ectopic pregnancy should be educated about the \\nrisks, including tubal rupture, hemorrhage and death. Ruptured \\nectopic pregnancy occurs more frequently in women who have \\nlimited contact with health-care providers and present late for \\ncare (Obed 2006). Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a gynecologic \\nemergency that requires immediate surgical intervention.\\nFor information about MA \\nfor termination of second-\\ntrimester intrauterine \\npregnancy, see Additional \\nResources, MA for Second-\\nTrimester Abortion.'),\n",

If there is uncertainty about the gestational age, or if \\nthere is a discrepancy between uterine size and gestational age \\nas determined by LMP, it may be helpful to use an ultrasound, if \\navailable, or to ask another clinician to check the uterine size by \\nbimanual exam.\\nFor more information on the use of history and bimanual exam \\nto confirm completion of medical abortion, please see Module 5: \\nFollow-Up Care.'),\n",

The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are \\nnonspecific and may be associated with threatened or spontaneous \\nabortion or normally developing intrauterine pregnancy. Even \\nwith careful screening, only half of women presenting to an \\nemergency room with ectopic pregnancy have risk factors or a \\nsuspicious physical exam (Stovall et al 1990). Ultrasound and \\nserial BHCG testing can aid in the diagnosis of unruptured \\nectopic pregnancy, but access to these tests may be limited in \\ndeveloping countries (Obed 2006).

Women’s experience \\nof pain is highly individual, which makes it impossible to predict \\nhow much pain a particular woman will experience. However, \\nthere are some predictors of pain associated with medical \\nabortion that apply in general. Older age, having given birth \\nbefore, and a higher number of previous births are associated with \\nreduced pain with medical abortion (Hamoda 2004, Suhonen 2011). \\nYoung women and women who have never been pregnant tend to \\nexperience increased pain. Women with painful periods may also \\nexperience increased pain with medical abortion independent of \\nother factors such as age or reproductive history (Suhonen 2011). \\nPain management\\nMost women find MA-related pain to be manageable, especially if \\nthey are prepared for the range of pain they might experience and \\ntake pain medicines as advised. Women should be provided with \\npain medication or a prescription at their first clinic visit.\\nThe best regimen for pain control for MA has not been \\nestablished (Jackson & Kapp 2011). NSAIDs such as ibuprofen \\nare more effective than acetaminophen (Livshits 2009). However, \\nacetaminophen may reduce the dose of narcotics that a woman \\nuses during MA (Jackson & Kapp 2011). The dose of acetaminophen \\nmust not exceed 4 grams in a 24-hour period to avoid liver toxicity \\n(Creinin 2009). Ibuprofen can be given with misoprostol (Avraham \\n2012) or once cramping starts (Livshits 2009). Ibuprofen does not \\nreduce the effectiveness of medical abortion. Narcotic analgesics \\nare another option for pain control although the optimal drug, \\ndose and timing is not known. One potential strategy is to provide \\nwomen with NSAIDs and narcotic analgesics and advise them \\nto begin with NSAIDs either with misoprostol or once cramping \\nstarts and alternate the two medications should they continue to \\nexperience pain. \\nIn addition to medical management, other methods that may help \\nwomen manage pain during a medical abortion are thorough \\ncounseling, a supportive environment and applying a heating \\npad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen. Music and guided \\nimagery are effective for pain management in surgical abortion \\nand may be helpful for medical abortion as well (Renner 2009). \\nThese methods are complementary but not adequate substitutes \\nfor pain management with medications.\\nResearch indicates that young women’s experiences with medical \\nabortion are similar to those of older women. However, pain \\nperception appears to be related to age. The perception of pain and \\nuse of analgesia has been found to be higher in younger women \\nthan older women (Hamoda 2004, Ingham & Lee 2008, Velazco \\n2000, Westhoff 2000a and 2000b). Lower parity has also been \\nassociated with increased perceived pain and/or analgesia needed \\n(Bartley 2000, Hamoda 2004, Honkanen 2004, Suhonen 2003, Teal \\n2007, Westhoff 2000a, Westhoff 2000b).

Most importantly in this study, women \\nwho had the proper expectations about duration and level of \\nbleeding were satisfied with their experience with MA. \\nAfter MA with mifepristone and misoprostol, the average duration \\nof bleeding is approximately 14 days (Spitz 1998, Davis 2000). \\nApproximately 20 percent of women undergoing MA continued to \\nbleed or spot for 35 to 42 days, which may include start of the first \\npostabortion menses (Davis 2000).\\nThere is less data about the duration of bleeding after MA with \\nmisoprostol only, though it appears to be similar to MA with \\nmifepristone and misoprostol.

Ongoing \\npregnancy is a particular concern with medical abortion because \\nof fetal exposure to the misoprostol and what effect it might have \\non the fetus if the woman chooses to continue the pregnancy. \\nThe rates of unsuccessful abortion and ongoing pregnancy are \\nsignificantly higher with misoprostol-only abortion compared to \\nthe combined mifepristone-misoprostol regimen and may increase \\nslightly with later gestations (see Table 4). The steps to assess a \\nsuccessful abortion are outlined in module 5.\\nWomen undergoing MA should understand that MA may fail to \\nend the pregnancy. Women with pregnancies that continue after \\nearly misoprostol exposure should be offered information and \\nuterine evacuation, as there is a slightly increased risk of birth \\ndefects. Providers should respect women’s informed decision on \\nthis issue\\n.\\nOther risks\\nOther rare risks include excessive bleeding requiring emergency \\ntreatment, transfusion, pelvic infection, allergic reactions and \\ndeath. \\n• The risk of very heavy bleeding requiring emergency \\ntreatment has been reported to range from two women in \\n10,000 to one in 100 (Ashok 1998, Hausknecht 2003, Schaff \\n1997). The wide variation in rates reflects differences in \\ngestational age and definition of heavy bleeding.\\n• The risk of serious infection has been reported to be less \\nthan 1 percent (Shannon 2004).\\n• Data about the rate of allergic reactions has not been \\ncollected but virtually all have resolved without treatment, or \\nhave been treated with antihistamines, such as Benadryl\\n®. \\n• Death is extremely rare. For example, the mortality rate from \\nfirst-trimester MA with mifepristone and misoprostol is \\nestimated to be about seven women per million (Grimes 2005, \\nRaymond & Grimes 2012).\\nPotential birth defects \\nThe risk of birth defects is estimated to be fewer than 10 defects \\nper 1,000 in pregnancies that continue after misoprostol use \\nduring the first trimester (Population Council 2002).

The health-care worker should ask the woman \\nif she has a companion with her and if she would prefer to be \\ncounseled by herself or if she would like her companion to hear \\nthe MA information as well. If she does, invite her companion to \\njoin the discussion.\\nBefore leaving the clinic, the woman should receive instructions \\nabout the normal MA experience, what pills to take, when and \\nhow to take them, when to follow up, and when and where to \\nseek medical help in case of a problem. Because some words \\nare probably unfamiliar to her (such as sublingual or buccal), \\nproviders should use simple language (such as “under the tongue” \\nand “inside the cheek” and can even provide drawings to visually \\naid her in understanding how medications should be taken \\neither at home or in the facility. Please see Modules 2a and 2b for \\nillustrations of routes.\\nWhen counseling a young woman, it is particularly important to \\nuse simple, non-clinical language to ensure understanding. Young \\nwomen may use different words than the ones that providers use \\n(de Bruyn & France 2001). Young women may have also had little \\nopportunity to learn about sexual and reproductive health, and \\nso may need more information and need the information repeated \\nmore frequently than many adult women. Also, they may be less \\ncomfortable and require more careful rapport-building. All these \\nfactors may result in counseling sessions with young women \\ntaking longer than with adult women (de Bruyn & Packer 2004).\\nA routine follow-up visit after medical abortion with mifepristone \\nfollowed by misoprostol is not necessary; however, because of \\nlower efficacy, routine follow-up after medical abortion with \\nmisoprostol only is recommended (WHO 2012). A woman who \\ntakes medication at home should receive explanation of how to \\nrecognize the signs of expulsion (bleeding and cramping) that \\noccur with a successful medical abortion. In general, women who \\nfeel they have had a successful medical abortion do not need \\nfurther care (Rossi 2004, Perriera 2010).  However, if a woman \\ntakes the medication and has minimal or no bleeding or still feels \\npregnant, she should return to the provider to check whether \\nshe has had a successful abortion or if she needs a procedure to \\ncomplete her abortion.

In \\nmultiple studies, women who believed that they had a successful \\nabortion were correct over 99% of the time (Rossi 2004, Perriera \\n2010, Cameron 2012, Jackson 2012).  \\nHowever, women are less accurate in assessing whether they have \\nhad an unsuccessful abortion or an ongoing pregnancy. Many but \\nnot all women may recognize an ongoing pregnancy from their \\nsymptoms alone. In one study of women treated with mifepristone \\nand misoprostol for first-trimester abortion, two-thirds of the \\nwomen with ongoing pregnancy recognized that they were still \\npregnant from their symptoms alone; the remaining third did not \\n(Jackson 2012). \\nThe risk of ongoing pregnancy for gestations less than 9 weeks \\nis less than 1% after mifepristone and misoprostol (von Hertzen \\n2010, Winikoff 2008, Tang 2003) and 4% - 6% after misoprostol \\nonly (vonHertzen 2007). Nonetheless, the importance of a woman \\nmissing an ongoing pregnancy is significant. If MA fails and \\nthe pregnancy continues, there is a slightly increased risk of \\nbirth defects from exposure to misoprostol. If there is a delay \\nin a woman’s identification of the ongoing pregnancy and she \\nwants to terminate it, the increased gestational age may limit her \\naccess to abortion services. To review success rates for medical \\nabortion, please see Module 4: Informed Consent, Information and \\nCounseling. \\nWhen desired or needed, success can also be confirmed by a \\nprovider at a follow-up visit approximately two weeks after \\nmedical abortion. Confirmation is usually possible by reviewing \\na symptom history and conducting a pelvic examination. \\nPregnancy testing and/or ultrasound may be useful (if available \\nor by referral) if a woman is unsure about whether she passed \\nher pregnancy. Use of less resource-intensive aids in determining \\nsuccess of MA, such as symptom diaries and questionnaires, is an \\narea of ongoing research. In addition to confirming success, the \\nprovider can offer contraception if desired, address problems and \\nanswer remaining questions.\\nSteps to assess successful abortion\\n1.  Ask the woman whether she felt like she expelled the pregnancy. \\nDid she have heavy bleeding and cramping after she took \\nmisoprostol?  Did she pass tissue or clots?  \\n2.  Ask the woman if she ever felt pregnant, and if she still \\nfeels pregnant now. Review what pregnancy symptoms she \\nexperienced prior to and after the abortion. For example, \\nif the woman had morning sickness and breast tenderness \\nbeforehand, has that resolved?'),\n",

In general, her bleeding and cramping \\nmay have been significant for about a day following misoprostol \\nbut then diminished over the following week.

Invite hospital staff to \\nthe clinic providing MA. \\nInformation sharing\\nIf a woman will be transferred to a referral hospital, providers \\nwill need to call the hospital to notify them that the woman is \\nbeing transported, why she is being referred for care, her history, \\nwhat measures have been taken in the clinic and her current \\ncondition.\\nDevelop a mechanism to receive records or verbal reports of a \\nwoman who received emergency care at the hospital so that the \\nclinic can stay informed of such cases and their outcome and \\nprovide appropriate follow-up care.\\nPracticing for emergencies\\nOn a routine basis, facility staff should review and practice how \\nthey will handle emergencies so that everyone knows their roles \\nand protocols. Staff need to practice how to treat hemorrhage, \\nshock, starting intravenous fluids, giving oxygen (if available), and \\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation.\\nSupplies\\nHave an emergency cart or container with all the medicines and \\nsupplies that may be useful in an emergency. Have a regular \\nmonthly check-list of the contents of the cart to be sure it is \\nstocked and that supplies and medications are not expired.\\nLinks to communities\\nProviders can work with community leaders and organizations, \\nparticularly women’s groups, to educate them about signs and \\nsymptoms of medical abortion complications that require prompt \\nmedical attention, as well as how and where women can receive \\nemergency care. Communities can prevent delays in getting women \\nwith emergencies to health services such as through community-\\nbased emergency transportation systems. Health-facility staff can \\ntrain community health workers or local health volunteers to refer'),\n",

A recent \\nstudy showed no difference in success rates, ongoing pregnancy and \\nadverse events in women from 8 to 9 weeks gestation and women \\nfrom 9 to 10 weeks.  Therefore, giving women between 9 and 10 \\nweeks buccal misoprostol at home is an option in some settings \\n(Winikoff, 2012). For MA between 10 and 13 weeks, misoprostol \\nshould only be given in the clinic.\\nHome use of misoprostol \\nMultiple studies from different countries have shown that \\ntaking misoprostol at home as part of a mifepristone and \\nmisoprostol regimen is safe, effective and highly acceptable to \\nwomen undergoing MA up to 9 weeks LMP (Fiala 2004, Elul 2001, \\nGuengant 1999). Although studies have not specifically evaluated \\nsafety, efficacy and acceptability of home use of misoprostol-\\nonly regimens, the option of home use has been included in some \\nstudies (von Hertzen 2007).\\nMany women prefer taking misoprostol at home with familiar \\nsurroundings, people and personal belongings. Doing this also can \\nsave them money in transportation costs as well as time. In turn, \\nit saves the facility staff resources as well.\\nStaff should give all women aborting at home the following:\\n• Misoprostol pills or a prescription for them\\n• Detailed information on how to take the misoprostol\\n• Pain medicine, such as ibuprofen and/or mild narcotics with \\ninstructions about how to take it (see details in Module 3: \\nClinical Care about pain management)\\n• Written and pictorial information on the MA process, side \\neffects and warning signs; what signs indicate that the \\nabortion is successful; and information for follow-up contact, \\nif desired\\n• Information on whom to contact (including a telephone \\nnumber, where possible) in case of questions, problems, \\ncomplications, or the possibility of an unsuccessful MA \\n• Other optional items: sanitary pads, cotton wool, \\ncontraceptive information and supplies\\nMany clinics give this information and supplies in a take-home \\npacket. It is also helpful to talk with each woman about her specific \\nsituation. For example, does she have a partner or support person \\nwho can be with her when she takes the misoprostol and also \\nafter when she is likely to begin bleeding? If she has children, has \\nshe arranged child care in case she needs to rest? Does she have \\nconcerns about seeing and disposing of the embryo after it expels?\\nA conversation about what to consider can help women to be most \\nprepared for their at-home medical abortion.'),\n",

Must be started within 120 hours (five days) of intercourse, but is most effective \\nif used as early as possible after unprotected intercourse. Copper containing IUDs can also be used as \\nEC, if they are inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse.\\nFetus - Beyond 10 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, the pregnancy is called a fetus; be-\\nfore 10 weeks, it is referred to as an embryo.\\nFirst Trimester - The first three months of pregnancy.\\nFollow-up - The visit, phone call, or other mechanism through which a health-care provider confirms \\nthat the woman’s abortion was successful and in which her progress is checked and any needs are \\nmet.\\nGestational Age - This is the duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of last menstrual \\ncycle. It is usually measured in weeks.\\nGestational Sac - A structure that develops in the uterus early in pregnancy; the first formation of an \\nembryonic structure. In an ultrasound, the gestational sac should be visible by five weeks of pregnan-\\ncy. In early pregnancy, the gestational sac is the first indication of an intrauterine pregnancy visible \\nby ultrasound. A yolk sac within the gestational sac confirms intrauterine pregnancy.\\nHydatidaform mole – An abnormal intrauterine growth of placental tissue that occurs after improp-\\ner fertilization. A molar pregnancy may be complete (no fetal tissue) or partial (abnormal fetal tissue) \\nbut is non-viable. Treatment includes removal and pathology review for definitive diagnosis.

These medications termi-\\nnate the pregnancy, which is then expelled by the uterus in a process similar to miscarriage. Medical \\nabortion is sometimes called medication abortion, pharmacological abortion, pharmaceutical abor-\\ntion or the abortion pill. Medical abortion does not include emergency contraception (EC), also known \\nas the “morning-after pill,” which prevents pregnancy from occurring.\\nMifepristone - Originally known as RU-486, it blocks progesterone activity in the uterus, which  \\nstops the growth of the fetus and leads to detachment of the pregnancy. Additionally, it sensitizes the \\nuterus to prostaglandins, increasing the impact of misoprostol, and helps to soften the cervix.\\nMisoprostol - A prostaglandin analogue administered at varying intervals to soften the cervix,  \\nstimulate uterine contractions and cause expulsion of the pregnancy. \\nMissed Abortion - A failed early pregnancy in which the pregnancy is no longer developing but the \\ntissue has not been expelled from the uterus.

Misoprostol is a \\nsynthetic (man-made) prostaglandin used to induce uterine contractions for childbirth or abortion.\\nRegimen - A plan or regulated course of behavior or treatment designed to give a particular result.\\nReproductive Health - A state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing in all matters relat-\\ning to the reproductive system and to its functions and processes.\\nRh-immunoglobulin - A substance given to prevent a woman who has Rh-negative blood from form-\\ning antibodies to the blood of an Rh-positive fetus if there is maternal/fetal blood transfer. If preg-\\nnant woman with Rh-negative blood is exposed to the blood of an Rh-positive fetus, she may become \\nsensitized. If she does become sensitized, the health of future pregnancies may be jeopardized be-\\ncause Rh antibodies cross the placenta and may cause the destruction of fetal red blood cells.\\nRU-486 - Name given to mifepristone during product development and sometimes still used to refer to \\nthe drug (see “Mifepristone”).\\nSanitary Pad - An absorbent “napkin” made of cotton or similar fibers that is worn against the vulva \\nto absorb menstrual flow.\\nSecond Trimester - The second 3 months of pregnancy.\\nSide Effects - A peripheral or secondary effect, especially an undesirable secondary effect, of a drug \\nor therapy. The most common side effects of medical abortion are caused by misoprostol. In addition \\nto cramps and bleeding (which are expected effects), other side effects may include headache, nausea, \\nvomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills or fatigue.\\nSonogram - A picture of the embryo or fetus in the uterus produced by the visualizing technology \\ncalled ultrasonography (see Ultrasound).\\nSpontaneous Abortion - A miscarriage; the natural, involuntary termination of a pregnancy before \\nviability. Spontaneous abortion occurs in at least 15-20 percent of all recognized pregnancies and \\nusually takes place before the 13th week of pregnancy.\\nSuccessful Abortion - The pregnancy is expelled or removed with no need for further intervention or \\ntreatment. A medical abortion is successful if the embryo and sac have been expelled and a woman \\ndoes not need an intervention due to problematic bleeding. On ultrasound, it is normal to see decidua \\nand thickened endometrial tissue after medical abortion—this does not require more treatment. \\nTampon - A firm roll of absorbent cotton or other fiber that is worn inside the vagina to absorb men-\\nstrual flow.'),\n",

In summary, \\nEC is not abortion and it must be taken within a few days of unprotected sex to prevent a \\npregnancy, whereas MA is an abortion of an existing pregnancy.\\n• Who can provide MA?\\n Any trained clinician can provide MA as long as she or he can estimate gestational age, \\ndetermine if a woman is eligible and provide follow-up in case of an emergency. MA providers \\ndo not have to provide vacuum aspiration services, but must be able to manage or refer in the \\nunusual case of an MA failure in the rare case that a complication occurs. \\nEligibility\\n• Is MA safe and effective for adolescents?\\n Yes, MA is safe and effective in adolescents (Phelps 2001) and has been found to be even more \\neffective in women who have never given birth (see below).\\n• Is MA less effective for women who have never had children (nulliparous women)?\\n MA is effective in women of any parity, especially in nulliparous women. In a retrospective \\nstudy of MA up to 49 days, it was found that the success rate was higher for nulliparous \\nwomen than for those women who have previously given birth (parous women) (Lefebvre 2008, \\nChien 2009).\\n• Can the MA regimen using only misoprostol be used in obese women and if so, do you need to \\nincrease the dose? \\n A retrospective study showed that MA with mifepristone and misoprostol in obese women has \\nthe same efficacy rates as non-obese women and that no increased dose is needed (Strafford \\n2009). It is fair to assume that the dosage does not need to be changed with misoprostol-only \\nabortions, but there are no studies to confirm this.\\n• Are there any precautions for women who have had prior cesarean-sections when using MA \\nbefore 13 weeks?\\n No. Women with prior cesarean-sections (c-sections) are eligible for MA. One study of MA \\nup to 56 days since LMP found that women who had previous c-sections had higher failure \\nrates (Chien 2009). This study was conducted using the less effective oral route of 400µg of \\nmisoprostol. There is little data on safety of MA for women with prior c-sections before 13 \\nweeks, but a recent review of second-trimester abortion (up to 26 weeks) with misoprostol \\nfound the risk of uterine rupture to be less than 0.3 percent (similar to vaginal delivery after \\nc-section) (Goyal 2009), so one can assume that the risk of uterine rupture is far lower in \\nabortions before 13 weeks. MA can be recommended for women with prior c-sections at this \\ngestational age.'),\n",

A woman who \\nhas had an MA before may choose to have an MA again at any time if she is eligible. \\n• Do women need to have access to a telephone in order to use MA?\\n No. MA has been provided for women in communities where there are no phones at all; in \\nthese cases, a woman would be taken by vehicle to a medical facility if a serious problem \\narose.\\nPractical advice\\n• Does the mifepristone dose need to be repeated if a woman vomits?\\n If the woman has kept down the mifepristone for 30 minutes, she doesn’t need a repeat dose \\nof mifepristone. If she vomits within 30 minutes, she should be given a repeat mifepristone \\n200mg pill. If a woman is known to have a problem with frequent vomiting with pregnancy, to \\nprevent her from vomiting the mifepristone, it may be helpful to give an anti-emetic or a light \\nsnack (toast or crackers) to settle her stomach prior to giving mifepristone.\\n• What practical advice can help women preparing to have MA?\\n Giving women clear expectations about pain and bleeding are important when providing MA. \\nProviders report that women who are well-hydrated feel better and endure the side effects \\nof misoprostol better. Encourage women who are having MA to drink plenty of non-alcoholic \\nbeverages throughout the entire process. \\n• Is it necessary for a woman to have an adult stay with her on the day she takes misoprostol?\\n Having a friend, partner or family member in the home or close by on the day the woman \\ntakes misoprostol is ideal. However, some women prefer to be alone and do not want others \\nwith them after they take misoprostol or go through the process of expelling the pregnancy. \\nIf a woman is alone, it is highly recommended that she has access to a telephone if she needs \\nhelp—or at least has someone checking in on her throughout the day. \\n• Can women undergoing MA use tampons?\\n Once the heavier bleeding has subsided a day or two after using misoprostol, she may use \\ntampons. Basically, she can use tampons when she’s comfortable doing so, but during the day \\nshe uses misoprostol, it’s easier to assess the amount of bleeding if she does not use tampons.\\n• Can women undergoing MA take a bath?\\n Women can bathe during the MA, but should not insert the misoprostol vaginally while in the \\nbathtub.\\n• Should certain foods be avoided while using MA?\\n Any foods that the woman is comfortable eating and do not cause nausea or vomiting are safe \\nto eat while using MA and will not interfere with the medications.\\n• Is there a right or wrong place to insert the misoprostol vaginally?\\n The medication in misoprostol will be absorbed if it is placed anywhere in the vagina. After \\nplacing the pills in the vagina it is recommended that the woman lie down for 30 minutes so \\nthe pills do not fall out. See “Vaginal Use of Misoprostol” in Module Two A or Two B.'),\n",

The active ingredient of misoprostol will absorb from the pill through the mucus \\nmembrane of the vagina, cheek or under the tongue into the woman’s bloodstream. The outer \\nshell casing of the pill may not dissolve; that is not a problem. If the woman inserted the \\nmisoprostol vaginally, as long as the misoprostol has been in the vagina for 30 minutes, \\nthe active medicine has absorbed. If she gets up and urinates, for example, and the pill \\ncasings come out, she doesn’t need to put them back in the vagina. Similarly, if she places the \\nmisoprostol in the cheek (buccal) or under the tongue (sublingual), even if the pills haven’t \\ndissolved, the active medicine has absorbed, and she should swallow the remaining pill \\nfragments 30 minutes later. \\n• How much time does the woman need to rest after using misoprostol?\\n This will depend on the woman and her other responsibilities and any underlying medical \\nconditions (such as anemia). Typically, women can resume normal activities as early as the \\nday after using misoprostol, although she will likely be bleeding for several days or weeks. \\nShe should not engage in heavy physical activity (such as heavy lifting or vigorous exercise) \\nfor about a week after MA. \\n• Some women tell their family members that they are having a miscarriage, not an abortion. \\nWill the family members be able to tell the difference?\\n MA is basically a miscarriage induced with medicines. Unless a woman reveals that she’s \\ntaken medicines, family members or others will not be able to tell the difference between a \\nmiscarriage and a medical abortion. Women may want to consider that when the vaginal route \\nof administration is used, remnants of the medicines may remain. \\n• Can young women use MA?\\n MA is safe and effective in adolescents. It may even be slightly more effective in women who \\nhave not given birth before, which is the case for many young women. \\n• Is it possible for an adolescent or woman to just tell others that she is having a heavy period (so \\nthat family members won’t know she was pregnant)?\\n A woman who doesn’t want to tell her family that she is having a medical abortion may \\nexplain that she is having a heavy period. Some young women living with their families have \\nhad a medical abortion and told their families they are having a heavy menstrual period—if \\nthey say anything at all—so family members won’t know they were pregnant. They should be \\ncounseled, however, that their plan to keep the abortion and pregnancy secret may not work if \\nthey experience very heavy bleeding that requires emergency treatment, which is not common \\nbut can occur.\\n If bleeding is considerably heavier than a menstrual period, it may be difficult for a woman \\nto keep this from family members—particularly if she only has access to communal sanitary \\nfacilities. If someone notices the excessive bleeding, a married woman may still be able to say \\nshe is having an early miscarriage, but an adolescent or unmarried woman may wish—or even \\nneed, for her own safety—to avoid any acknowledgement of pregnancy. For this reason, women \\nshould be informed in advance of the possibility of heavy bleeding so they can plan accordingly.\\n• Can a woman use MA if she is pregnant with twins?\\n Yes. A woman who is pregnant with twins or other multiple gestations may take mifepristone \\nand misoprostol using the standard dosages of medications. The success rate is similar to the \\nsuccess rate for singleton pregnancies.'),\n",

Most women are able to determine whether their abortion \\nwas successful. However, routine follow-up may be offered if a woman wants reassurance \\nthat she has passed her pregnancy. Follow-up must be available for women who experience \\ncomplications or have a failed MA. For providers using misoprostol only, follow-up is \\nrecommended as the success rates are significantly lower. \\n• For those doing ultrasound at follow-up, what if an empty sac (not an ongoing pregnancy) is \\nseen at the follow-up visit?\\n If an empty gestational sac is seen on follow-up ultrasound, expectant management (waiting \\nand watching) can be used or an additional dose of misoprostol can be offered. A small study \\nof 800µg of misoprostol vaginally for MA up to 63 days since LMP found that more than half \\nof women expelled the gestational sac 1 week after the repeat dose of misoprostol (Reeves \\n2008). Women’s wishes to avoid surgery and instrumentation should be considered. Uterine \\naspiration may be necessary if the woman is symptomatic for bleeding problems.\\n• If the woman is still pregnant at the follow-up visit, can the dose of mifepristone and \\nmisoprostol be repeated?\\n If the woman is still pregnant at the follow-up visit, this is considered a MA failure and \\nstandard practice is to refer her for uterine aspiration. A repeat dose of misoprostol 1 week \\nafter the MA for ongoing pregnancies has been studied and found to have limited success \\n(about 30 percent) but is another option that can be considered to avoid uterine aspiration \\n(Reeves 2008). Repeating the entire regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol has not been \\nstudied and is not recommended.\\n• When will menstruation return after MA?\\n A study found that menses typically return about 33 days after MA (Davis 2000). \\n• Will clinicians receive a lot of after-hour phone calls when providing MA?\\n Clinicians receive fewer after-hours calls as they gain experience with MA. This is simply \\nbecause they learn how to communicate more clearly and effectively with women about what \\nto expect with the MA process. The amount of calls received after hours will depend on the \\nquality of the counseling and advance guidance given to women at the initial visit for MA. \\nWomen’s questions will lead providers to improve counseling by remembering to answer \\nthese concerns during subsequent clinic visits. \\n• What if a woman has an ongoing pregnancy at the follow-up visit and refuses to terminate the \\npregnancy?\\n Clinicians cannot force women to terminate a pregnancy, but should inform women of the \\npotential risk of birth defects should that pregnancy continue. At the initial visit, part of the \\ncounseling is to assess whether the woman is committed to the steps necessary to terminate \\nthe pregnancy, including vacuum aspiration if necessary. See “Potential Birth Defects” in \\nModule Four.\\n• What if clinicians observe repeated failures of MA?\\n The first step in evaluating what is perceived to be a high failure rate with MA is to determine \\nwhat the actual failure rate is over time and also to determine whether failure is truly due to \\nongoing pregnancy or if providers are intervening for other reasons.'),\n",

If this occurs frequently, a quality assurance \\nreview should be done to determine if these interventions were medically necessary. The \\nintervention rates of different providers (with ongoing pregnancy separated out) can be \\ncompared to see if there is wide variation in intervention rates, and then to determine why \\nthe intervention rate of one clinician is higher than the others. In a group of experienced \\nclinicians using a highly effective regimen, the intervention rate, not including intervention \\nfor ongoing pregnancy, is about 1 to 2 percent (Fjerstad 2009, Raghavan 2009). Clinicians who \\nare inexperienced with MA tend to intervene more at first because they are not confident in \\nthe method, not comfortable with the amount of time a woman may bleed after MA or simply \\nbecause they believe a uterine evacuation would resolve any potential problems. As clinicians \\ngain experience and confidence with MA, success rates rise and unnecessary interventions \\ndecrease (Borgatta 2000, Suhonen 2003). Basically, intervention is not needed as long as the \\nwoman feels well and does not have a viable (growing) pregnancy.\\n If it is determined that there is a higher-than-expected rate of ongoing pregnancy (which is \\na biologic outcome and is not dependent on clinician judgment or the possibility of over-\\nintervention), then a different analysis and response is needed. The ongoing pregnancies may \\nbe just coincidence, or it is possible that the batch of medicines is faulty or expired, or that \\nthe medicines were not taken properly. Review the expiration dates, the storage conditions \\nfor misoprostol and assure that the medicines were taken as directed and contact the \\nmanufacturer with any concerns. \\n Mifepristone is a very stable medicine with a long shelf life. There have been many anecdotal \\nreports about batches of misoprostol that resulted in high failure rates. Because misoprostol \\nis hygroscopic (that is, it attracts moisture), it can become ineffective if it remains in opened \\nbottles for a long time, especially in moist, humid or hot environments. Providers have \\nreported unexpected groups of failures; but when they used a new lot or a new bottle of \\nmisoprostol, failure rates returned to the usual low baseline rates. Misoprostol should always \\nbe stored in a cool dry area of the clinic. \\n• What are the psychological after-effects of MA?\\n The research on mental health after abortion is controversial as it is often politically \\nmotivated and prone to bias. In 2008, after extensive review of the evidence, the American \\nPsychological Association concluded that in general, women who terminate an unplanned, \\nundesired pregnancy are at no increased risk of mental health problems compared to other \\nwomen. Individual women, however, may be at greater risk of mental health problems \\nafterwards, particularly women who suffer from stigma, abuse, low social support, or pre-\\nexisting depression or anxiety. These women should be supported throughout and after their \\nabortion (Major et al 2009).'),\n",

Correct answers are listed in the answer key.\\nThe Reflect section is designed to stimulate thinking about what is \\ncurrently in place for MA services and how to apply the contents \\nof the study guide to actual service delivery settings. \\nSecond edition\\nThis study guide was designed to train providers on the delivery \\nof high-quality, clinic-based, first-trimester medical abortion \\n(MA), particularly in limited-resource settings. This second edition \\nhas been updated to reflect the latest evidence from the World \\nHealth Organization (WHO 2012 ) and other important source \\ndocuments.  These updates include current clinical evidence and \\nrecommendations on providing appropriate MA care to young \\nwomen and working with communities to improve information, \\nsocial support and access.\\nThis curriculum focuses on provision of MA by trained health-\\ncare providers working in facilities in the formal health-care \\nsystem. There is increasing attention on making MA information \\nand drugs more widely available to women in real and virtual \\ncommunities outside the formal health system, particularly in \\nsettings where women face serious risks due to lack of access to \\nsafe services. Ipas has policies, materials and programs to support \\nthese efforts. In this second edition, we have included some \\nrecommendations on how to increase access and improve linkages \\nbetween communities and health facilities. For more information \\non this, please see Additional Resources, Community Access.\\nIn this second edition, we address young women’s unique needs in \\nan effort to increase MA service delivery and access. Young women \\nare disproportionately affected by unsafe abortion. Girls aged 10 \\n-19 in developing countries undergo at least 2.2 to 4 million unsafe \\nabortions and account for approximately 45 percent of unsafe \\nabortion-related deaths each year (WHO 2007).  Women under the age \\nof 20 make up 70 percent of all hospitalizations from unsafe abortion \\ncomplications (Plan 2007).  We note where there is evidence for any \\nclinical or other differences for young versus adult women. Where it \\nis relevant, we also note where there is a lack of evidence. Throughout \\nthis manual, we generally refer to young women (ages 10-24). Where \\nthe evidence specifically applies to adolescents (ages 10-19, per WHO), \\nwe use that term.

The \\nMedical Abortion Study Guide and the companion Training Guide \\nwere designed to accompany Ipas’s more comprehensive abortion \\ncare training curriculum, Woman-Centered, Comprehensive \\nAbortion Care: Reference and Trainer’s Manuals, Second Edition. \\nThere are three major components to this training program:\\n• Self-directed study\\n• In-person workshop\\n• Clinical practicum\\nThis blended learning approach combines the acquisition of \\nessential knowledge through self-guided study with skills \\ndevelopment in a face-to-face workshop setting that can then be \\napplied to an actual clinical practice setting during the practicum. \\nAs a participant in this training program, individuals are required to \\ncomplete self-guided study using the Medical Abortion Study Guide \\nprior to attending the workshop and practicum. We recommend \\nadministering a pre-test prior to the workshop that covers the \\ninformation included in the MA Study Guide and requiring learners \\nto score 75 percent or higher on this test to participate in the \\nworkshop and practicum. This requirement ensures all trainees have \\na base of requisite knowledge that they apply through skills practice \\nin the in-person training and practicum.\\nLearners who do not have access to mifepristone can skip Module \\n2A, Medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol, and \\ninstead use Module 2B, Medical abortion with misoprostol only. \\nBecause MA using both mifepristone and misoprostol is more \\neffective than misoprostol only, Ipas recommends that MA be \\nprovided with the combination of the two wherever possible. \\nAdditional options for self-guided learning are available at \\nIpasUniversity, which offers free, online, on-demand courses \\nfor reproductive health professionals on safe abortion care and \\npostabortion care. These courses can be used for self-guided \\nlearning or as the online component of a blended learning model. \\nFor the IpasUniversity course catalog, see http://www.ipas.org/en/\\nResources/Ipas%20Publications/IpasUniversity-course-catalog.\\naspx; to register and take courses, please go to www.IpasU.org.\\nAbout the MA Training Program'),\n",

Worldwide \\nin 2008, 21.6 million unsafe abortions took place, leading to an \\nestimated 47,000 preventable maternal deaths (WHO 2011). In low-'),\n",

In 2003, young women comprised \\napproximately 45 percent of all estimated unsafe abortion-related \\ndeaths globally (WHO 2007) and stand to benefit from the many \\nadvantages of MA. Therefore we make special mention of MA for \\nyoung women whenever appropriate in this study guide and hope \\nthis will lead to increased service delivery and access for young \\nwomen.\\nThis module provides a short overview of first-trimester \\nabortion methods, describes how MA has the potential to \\nimprove access to safe abortion care, and briefly reviews MA \\nacceptability. Subsequent modules include details on success \\nrates, drug regimens, side effects, pain medications, follow-up and \\ncomplications.\\nAbortion methods\\nUterine evacuation (removal of the contents of the uterus) may \\nbe accomplished in the first trimester by medications, vacuum \\naspiration or sharp curettage. Although sharp curettage is \\ncommon in many countries, WHO guidelines state that it should \\nbe used only when vacuum aspiration or MA are not available \\n(WHO  2012). A recent statement by the International Federation \\nof Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) supported the use of vacuum \\naspiration or medications over sharp curettage for uterine \\nevacuation (FIGO 2011). Therefore, health-system officials and \\nadministrators should make all possible efforts to replace sharp \\ncurettage with vacuum aspiration or MA. If services are being \\nintroduced for the first time, vacuum aspiration and medical \\nabortion should be introduced rather than sharp curettage.\\nWith vacuum aspiration, the contents of the uterus are evacuated \\nthrough a plastic or metal cannula using suction provided by a \\nhandheld, portable aspirator (manual vacuum aspiration) or by an \\nelectric pump (electric vacuum aspiration). Vacuum aspiration is \\nan important alternative to and occasional back-up for MA.\\nMA, a globally endorsed method, involves the use of various \\nmedicines to evacuate the uterus. WHO stated in 2003 and \\nreiterated in 2012 that “medical methods of abortion have been \\nproved to be safe and effective” (WHO 2003, WHO 2012). In 2005 \\nWHO added mifepristone with misoprostol and misoprostol only \\nto its Model List of Essential Medicines (WHO 2005). Mifepristone \\nwith misoprostol was also included in the Interagency List of \\nEssential Medicines for Reproductive Health, compiled by several \\nof the UN agencies and other international NGOs, specifically for \\nmedical abortion within 9 weeks gestation (WHO 2006).\\nThe medications mifepristone and misoprostol are increasingly \\nused worldwide for MA (Gynuity Health Projects 2011).

This study guide focuses on the \\nuse of mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol only.\\nAdolescents may use the same methods of uterine evacuation \\nas adult women.  A recent study showed that adolescent women \\nseeking medical abortion have similar or lower rates of adverse \\noutcomes than adult women (Niinimäki 2011).\\nAccess\\nMA has the potential to greatly improve access to safe abortion \\nand may be particularly beneficial in settings where uterine \\nevacuation services are limited or completely unavailable. MA \\noffers the following advantages in low-resource settings or in \\ncommunities where access to safe abortion is restricted:\\n• MA services are simple to deliver, easy to manage and the \\nmedications do not require refrigeration. MA may require \\nless equipment, facilities and staffing.\\n• MA may be more accessible than vacuum aspiration because \\nmany provider cadres can be trained to provide MA, and \\nresearch has demonstrated that appropriately trained cadres \\nof providers can administer medical abortion as safely as \\ndoctors in low-resource settings (Warriner, et al 2011). This \\nfacilitates care being provided at the most local level, close \\nto where women live and work. This may particularly benefit \\nyoung women, who are known to have reduced access to safe \\nabortion (Turner 2011).\\n• In many settings, clinicians can provide information on \\ncorrect MA doses and regimens to women even if they are not \\nauthorized to directly dispense the drugs. \\n• In settings where sharp curettage has been the main method \\nof uterine evacuation, MA provides an especially desirable \\nalternative, eliminating the potential need for general \\nanesthesia and a hospital stay.\\n• MA is the safest and perhaps only abortion option available \\nin some clinical situations (Creinin 1996):\\n— When a woman has certain uterine anomalies that \\npreclude the use of MVA or sharp curettage   \\n— When cervical dilation is or would be difficult, such as \\nwith cervical stenosis.\\n• MA may be cost-effective when compared with other \\nmethods. Costs vary depending on the price of medications, \\nnumber of clinic visits and specific clinical protocols (Murthy \\n&Creinin 2003, Creinin 2000).'),\n",

Studies consistently \\nshow that 85 to 95 percent of women are satisfied or highly \\nsatisfied with the method, and would be willing to use it again or \\nrecommend it to a friend if needed (Winikoff 1997, Karki 2009). \\nWomen should be given a choice of method whenever possible and \\nbe provided sufficient information to make an informed decision. \\nYoung women in multiple settings have similarly high satisfaction \\nwith MA(Carbonell 2001, Creinin 1996, Mamers 1997, Phelps 2001, \\nVelazco 2000) and 92 percent of the young women in the Cuba \\nstudies would recommend the method to a friend (Carbonell 2001, \\nVelazco 2000).\\n• Women often mention the non-surgical aspect of MA, \\ncompared to a vacuum aspiration procedure, as a significant \\nbenefit. \\n• Some women, including young women, perceive MA as a \\nmore private and natural method.

An ectopic pregnancy occurs \\nwhen a fertilized egg attaches itself outside of the uterus, most \\noften in a fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancy is rare, occurring \\nin less than 1% of women presenting for an abortion (Edwards \\n& Creinin 1997). If an ectopic pregnancy is unrecognized, it can \\ncause potentially life-threatening complications from rupture and \\nhemorrhage. For this reason, ectopic pregnancy is a leading cause \\nof maternal mortality in the first trimester (Khan 2006, WHO 1985). \\nTherefore, providers should maintain a high index of suspicion \\nfor ectopic pregnancy and carefully evaluate women’s risk before \\nproviding medical abortion. Uterine evacuation methods, whether \\nvacuum aspiration or MA using misoprostol with or without \\nmifepristone, will not terminate an ectopic pregnancy. Any woman \\nwith a suspected ectopic pregnancy should be educated about the \\nrisks, including tubal rupture, hemorrhage and death. Ruptured \\nectopic pregnancy occurs more frequently in women who have \\nlimited contact with health-care providers and present late for \\ncare (Obed 2006). Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a gynecologic \\nemergency that requires immediate surgical intervention.\\nSpecial considerations\\nMA with mifepristone and misoprostol may be given to women in \\nthe following categories:\\nYoung women\\nMA is safe and effective in adolescents (Phelps 2001). MA has been \\nshown to be even more effective in women who have not given \\nbirth before (Chien 2009, Le Febvre 2008). MA failure was found \\nto be independently associated with women’s older age, previous \\nspontaneous abortions, multigravidity and earlier follow-up visit \\n(Haimov-Kochman 2007). A Finnish study found that adolescents had \\nfewer incomplete abortions, less need for surgical (re)evacuation, \\nfewer hemorrhages and fewer complications than non-adolescents \\nhaving surgical and medical abortion (Niinimäki 2011).\\nAsthma\\nWomen using asthma inhalers including inhaled corticosteroids \\nmay have MA, because the medications in asthma inhalers are \\nnot systemically absorbed. Although some prostaglandins are \\nvasoconstrictors, misoprostol is a type of prostaglandin that \\npromotes bronchodilation, decreases inflammation and increases \\noxygen flow (Bernstein & Kandinow 2004).\\nHIV and AIDS\\nWomen living with HIV and AIDS may use MA.'),\n",

Routine ultrasound may increase the cost of \\nthe procedure and the likelihood of unnecessary intervention; it \\nmay also prevent some providers from offering MA due to a lack \\nof equipment (Gynuity 2007). MA can be offered even if ultrasound \\nservices are not available.\\nTo learn more about ultrasound, please see Additional Resources, \\nUltrasound.\\nEctopic pregnancy\\nEctopic pregnancy may be suspected in women during clinical \\nassessment for MA due to her history, risk factors or physical \\nexam or in the course of follow-up care (Yao & Tulandi 1997, \\nBarnhart 2009). The symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are \\nnonspecific and may be associated with threatened or spontaneous \\nabortion or normally developing intrauterine pregnancy. Even \\nwith careful screening, only half of women presenting to an \\nemergency room with ectopic pregnancy have risk factors or a \\nsuspicious physical exam (Stovall et al 1990). Ultrasound and \\nserial BHCG testing can aid in the diagnosis of unruptured \\nectopic pregnancy, but access to these tests may be limited in \\ndeveloping countries (Obed 2006). Vacuum aspiration can assist \\nin the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. If a woman has risk factors \\nor signs and symptoms of an unruptured ectopic pregnancy, \\nvacuum aspiration and careful tissue inspection can confirm an \\nintrauterine pregnancy (Rubin et al 1980). \\nAntibiotics\\nInfection rates after MA are very low (Shannon 2004).

In settings where the prevalence of Rh-negative status is \\nhigh and Rh-immunoglobulin is available and affordable, it can be \\ngiven to Rh-negative women at the time of taking the mifepristone \\nor prior to taking misoprostol.\\nThere are no data regarding the risk of sensitization of Rh-\\nnegative women who have MA after 9 weeks (Fiala 2003). When \\nproviding MA for 10 through 13 weeks, providers should follow \\nthe local standard for Rh-testing and giving Rh-immunoglobulin \\nfor Rh-negative women as is used for other types of uterine \\nevacuation (e.g. aspiration abortion and miscarriage).\\nAbortion process  \\nThorough information on what the woman might expect helps \\nher to be prepared.

Women’s experience \\nof pain is highly individual, which makes it impossible to predict \\nhow much pain a particular woman will experience. However, \\nthere are some predictors of pain associated with medical \\nabortion that apply in general. Older age, having given birth \\nbefore, and a higher number of previous births are associated with \\nreduced pain with medical abortion (Hamoda 2004, Suhonen 2011). \\nYoung women and women who have never been pregnant tend to \\nexperience increased pain. Women with painful periods may also \\nexperience increased pain with medical abortion independent of \\nother factors such as age or reproductive history (Suhonen 2011). \\nPain management\\nMost women find MA-related pain to be manageable, especially if \\nthey are prepared for the range of pain they might experience and \\ntake pain medicines as advised. Women should be provided with \\npain medication or a prescription at their first clinic visit.\\nThe best regimen for pain control for MA has not been \\nestablished (Jackson & Kapp 2011). NSAIDs such as ibuprofen \\nare more effective than acetaminophen (Livshits 2009). However, \\nacetaminophen may reduce the dose of narcotics that a woman \\nuses during MA (Jackson & Kapp 2011). The dose of acetaminophen \\nmust not exceed 4 grams in a 24-hour period to avoid liver toxicity \\n(Creinin 2009). Ibuprofen can be given with misoprostol (Avraham \\n2012) or once cramping starts (Livshits 2009). Ibuprofen does not \\nreduce the effectiveness of medical abortion. Narcotic analgesics \\nare another option for pain control although the optimal drug, \\ndose and timing is not known. One potential strategy is to provide \\nwomen with NSAIDs and narcotic analgesics and advise them \\nto begin with NSAIDs either with misoprostol or once cramping \\nstarts and alternate the two medications should they continue to \\nexperience pain. \\nIn addition to medical management, other methods that may help \\nwomen manage pain during a medical abortion are thorough \\ncounseling, a supportive environment and applying a heating \\npad or hot water bottle to the lower abdomen. Music and guided \\nimagery are effective for pain management in surgical abortion \\nand may be helpful for medical abortion as well (Renner 2009). \\nThese methods are complementary but not adequate substitutes \\nfor pain management with medications.\\nResearch indicates that young women’s experiences with medical \\nabortion are similar to those of older women. However, pain \\nperception appears to be related to age. The perception of pain and \\nuse of analgesia has been found to be higher in younger women \\nthan older women (Hamoda 2004, Ingham & Lee 2008, Velazco \\n2000, Westhoff 2000a and 2000b). Lower parity has also been \\nassociated with increased perceived pain and/or analgesia needed \\n(Bartley 2000, Hamoda 2004, Honkanen 2004, Suhonen 2003, Teal \\n2007, Westhoff 2000a, Westhoff 2000b).

With a combined regimen, bleeding most often starts \\nwithin three hours after taking misoprostol (Creinin 2003) and \\ntends to decrease after the pregnancy tissue has been expelled \\n(Paul 2007).\\nDuration of bleeding\\nIn one of the few large studies to follow the bleeding patterns of \\nwomen choosing MA or aspiration, the duration of heavy bleeding, \\nmenstrual-type bleeding and spotting was significantly longer \\nin women undergoing MA. (Harper 1998)  Despite the longer \\nduration of bleeding, women who had MA did not have a clinically \\nsignificant drop in hemoglobin (>2g/dL) when compared to women \\nwho had an aspiration. Most importantly in this study, women \\nwho had the proper expectations about duration and level of \\nbleeding were satisfied with their experience with MA. \\nAfter MA with mifepristone and misoprostol, the average duration \\nof bleeding is approximately 14 days (Spitz 1998, Davis 2000). \\nApproximately 20 percent of women undergoing MA continued to \\nbleed or spot for 35 to 42 days, which may include start of the first \\npostabortion menses (Davis 2000).\\nThere is less data about the duration of bleeding after MA with \\nmisoprostol only, though it appears to be similar to MA with \\nmifepristone and misoprostol. In the largest study of misoprostol–\\nonly abortion, the mean duration of bleeding was around 11.5 \\ndays, which is similar to combined regimens (von Hertzen 2007). \\nDiscussing bleeding and pain with women\\nClinicians new to MA, as well as women themselves, will have \\nquestions about how to tell the difference between normal \\nand abnormal bleeding and pain. All women should be given \\ninformation about the bleeding and pain they might experience \\nduring medical abortion, keeping in mind factors that might put \\nthem at higher or lower risk of experiencing these symptoms. \\nAccurately describing the sensations a woman might feel during \\na medical abortion can alleviate fear and anxiety that may \\nmake pain worse (Kruse 2000). The bell curve (Figure 1) may be \\nhelpful for both providers and patients to understand a range of \\nsymptoms women might experience. Providers may use the bell'),\n",

However, some women will be at either ends of the curve \\nand will experience less or more symptoms than most women. \\nNot all women will understand the picture of the bell curve, but \\nthey all should be told about the range of symptoms they might \\nexperience in a way that makes sense to them. \\nFigure 1: The Bell Curve\\nAlthough some women do not feel any pain and others experience \\nintense pain, the majority of women fall somewhere in the middle. \\nSimilarly, most women have bleeding that lasts around two weeks \\nbut some will have more and others less. \\nA woman may have concerns about where she may begin bleeding \\nand how to maintain privacy and obtain support during the \\nabortion process. Her provider should be prepared to support \\nher in thinking through and deciding on the most private and \\ncomfortable location to have her abortion and who in her family \\nor social network might be the most supportive and trustworthy \\nperson to support her through the process. \\nTiming of expulsion\\nWith the mifepristone and misoprostol regimen before 9 weeks \\ngestation, the median time from misoprostol use to expulsion \\nhas been found to be three hours for women who used sublingual \\nmisoprostol and four hours for women who used vaginal \\nmisoprostol (von Hertzen 2010). The buccal route shows timing \\nsimilar to that of the vaginal route (Meckstroth 2006, Schaff 2005).\\nFor misoprostol-only abortion, the average expulsion time is \\nseven to eight hours after the first misoprostol dose (Salakos 2005, \\nvon Hertzen 2007). Of the expulsions that occur, 80 percent take \\nplace within 24 hours and 95 percent take place within 48 hours \\n(Faundes 2007). Expulsion is faster if the dosing interval is shorter \\n(every 3 hours) (von Hertzen 2007). \\nNo noticeable pain Intense pain\\nlight bleeding heavy bleeding\\nNumber of women\\nMost women’s experience will fall somewhere in the middle  \\nand few women’s experience will fall on either end.'),\n",

Providers should give pain medicine while the woman \\nis in the health-care facility. Pain medicine may be started with \\nthe first dose of misoprostol before the woman has pain and \\ncan be repeated as frequently as needed.

If the time between doses is increased, the success \\nrates decrease and the time to expulsion lengthens. Even if a \\nwoman has pain or cramping, the provider should give the next \\ndose of misoprostol until the woman expels the pregnancy.

To some women, \\nhaving an abortion using pills instead of instruments allows for \\nmore privacy and feels more like a natural process. Some women \\nwill tell family members that they are having a heavy period or \\na spontaneous miscarriage during the MA process. If the woman \\nwants more support, she might choose to have family or friends \\nwith her.\\nRisks (See also Module Six, Complications)\\nEvery medical procedure carries some risk, which must be \\nbalanced against the risk of not having the procedure. Carrying \\na pregnancy to term has a higher risk of morbidity and mortality \\nthan terminating an early pregnancy (Raymond & Grimes 2012). \\nThe risk of death with MA is roughly equal to the risk of death \\nwith spontaneous abortion (Grimes 2005). Both vacuum aspiration \\nand MA are very safe, but they do have some risk. Vacuum \\naspiration and MA both may cause heavy bleeding or infection. \\nWith both methods of uterine evacuation there is the risk of \\nfailure to complete the abortion. And for both procedures, there \\nis a risk that if the initial procedure is not successful, women \\nmay need additional care to complete the abortion. With vacuum \\naspiration, there is risk of injury from the instruments, and if \\nanesthesia is used, risk of reaction to anesthesia. In MA, there is \\nthe risk of side effects from the drugs. \\n Unsuccessful abortion Ongoing Pregnancy\\n Mifepristone-Misoprostol\\n  <9 weeks (von Hertzen 2010, Winikoff 2008, Tang 2003) 3% <1%\\n  9-10 weeks with single dose of buccal misoprostol 7% 3%\\n  (Winikoff 2012)  \\n  10-13 weeks with repeat doses of misoprostol 3%-5% 1%-2%\\n  (Hamoda 2005a&b, Ashok 2002b)\\n Misoprostol Only\\n   <9 weeks (vonHertzen 2007) 15%-17% 4%-6%\\n   9-13 weeks (Carbonell 1998, 1999a, 2008) 13%-17% 7%-8%\\nTable 4-2: Rates of unsuccessful abortion and ongoing pregnancy after medical abortion'),\n",

Ongoing \\npregnancy is a particular concern with medical abortion because \\nof fetal exposure to the misoprostol and what effect it might have \\non the fetus if the woman chooses to continue the pregnancy. \\nThe rates of unsuccessful abortion and ongoing pregnancy are \\nsignificantly higher with misoprostol-only abortion compared to \\nthe combined mifepristone-misoprostol regimen and may increase \\nslightly with later gestations (see Table 4). The steps to assess a \\nsuccessful abortion are outlined in module 5.\\nWomen undergoing MA should understand that MA may fail to \\nend the pregnancy. Women with pregnancies that continue after \\nearly misoprostol exposure should be offered information and \\nuterine evacuation, as there is a slightly increased risk of birth \\ndefects. Providers should respect women’s informed decision on \\nthis issue\\n.\\nOther risks\\nOther rare risks include excessive bleeding requiring emergency \\ntreatment, transfusion, pelvic infection, allergic reactions and \\ndeath. \\n• The risk of very heavy bleeding requiring emergency \\ntreatment has been reported to range from two women in \\n10,000 to one in 100 (Ashok 1998, Hausknecht 2003, Schaff \\n1997). The wide variation in rates reflects differences in \\ngestational age and definition of heavy bleeding.\\n• The risk of serious infection has been reported to be less \\nthan 1 percent (Shannon 2004).\\n• Data about the rate of allergic reactions has not been \\ncollected but virtually all have resolved without treatment, or \\nhave been treated with antihistamines, such as Benadryl\\n®. \\n• Death is extremely rare. For example, the mortality rate from \\nfirst-trimester MA with mifepristone and misoprostol is \\nestimated to be about seven women per million (Grimes 2005, \\nRaymond & Grimes 2012).\\nPotential birth defects \\nThe risk of birth defects is estimated to be fewer than 10 defects \\nper 1,000 in pregnancies that continue after misoprostol use \\nduring the first trimester (Population Council 2002). The most \\ncommon misoprostol-related birth defects are mobius sequence \\n(facial nerve paralysis with associated anomalies) and limb defects \\n(dal Pizzol 2006).

For a comprehensive review of the association of \\nmisoprostol with birth defects, please see Additional Resources, \\nBirth Defect Risks with MA .\\nExplaining the MA process to women\\nUsing simple, non-technical language, health-care staff should \\nhelp the woman understand the entire process before she takes \\nany medications. The health-care worker should ask the woman \\nif she has a companion with her and if she would prefer to be \\ncounseled by herself or if she would like her companion to hear \\nthe MA information as well. If she does, invite her companion to \\njoin the discussion.\\nBefore leaving the clinic, the woman should receive instructions \\nabout the normal MA experience, what pills to take, when and \\nhow to take them, when to follow up, and when and where to \\nseek medical help in case of a problem. Because some words \\nare probably unfamiliar to her (such as sublingual or buccal), \\nproviders should use simple language (such as “under the tongue” \\nand “inside the cheek” and can even provide drawings to visually \\naid her in understanding how medications should be taken \\neither at home or in the facility. Please see Modules 2a and 2b for \\nillustrations of routes.\\nWhen counseling a young woman, it is particularly important to \\nuse simple, non-clinical language to ensure understanding. Young \\nwomen may use different words than the ones that providers use \\n(de Bruyn & France 2001). Young women may have also had little \\nopportunity to learn about sexual and reproductive health, and \\nso may need more information and need the information repeated \\nmore frequently than many adult women. Also, they may be less \\ncomfortable and require more careful rapport-building. All these \\nfactors may result in counseling sessions with young women \\ntaking longer than with adult women (de Bruyn & Packer 2004).\\nA routine follow-up visit after medical abortion with mifepristone \\nfollowed by misoprostol is not necessary; however, because of \\nlower efficacy, routine follow-up after medical abortion with \\nmisoprostol only is recommended (WHO 2012). A woman who \\ntakes medication at home should receive explanation of how to \\nrecognize the signs of expulsion (bleeding and cramping) that \\noccur with a successful medical abortion. In general, women who \\nfeel they have had a successful medical abortion do not need \\nfurther care (Rossi 2004, Perriera 2010).  However, if a woman \\ntakes the medication and has minimal or no bleeding or still feels \\npregnant, she should return to the provider to check whether \\nshe has had a successful abortion or if she needs a procedure to \\ncomplete her abortion.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Medical-book.pdf'}, page_content='52     Module 5: Follow-Up Care\\nIpas Medical Abortion Study Guide\\nConfirming success\\nWomen and their providers are very accurate in assessing the \\nsuccess of MA using mifepristone followed by misoprostol. In \\nmultiple studies, women who believed that they had a successful \\nabortion were correct over 99% of the time (Rossi 2004, Perriera \\n2010, Cameron 2012, Jackson 2012).  \\nHowever, women are less accurate in assessing whether they have \\nhad an unsuccessful abortion or an ongoing pregnancy. Many but \\nnot all women may recognize an ongoing pregnancy from their \\nsymptoms alone. In one study of women treated with mifepristone \\nand misoprostol for first-trimester abortion, two-thirds of the \\nwomen with ongoing pregnancy recognized that they were still \\npregnant from their symptoms alone; the remaining third did not \\n(Jackson 2012). \\nThe risk of ongoing pregnancy for gestations less than 9 weeks \\nis less than 1% after mifepristone and misoprostol (von Hertzen \\n2010, Winikoff 2008, Tang 2003) and 4% - 6% after misoprostol \\nonly (vonHertzen 2007). Nonetheless, the importance of a woman \\nmissing an ongoing pregnancy is significant. If MA fails and \\nthe pregnancy continues, there is a slightly increased risk of \\nbirth defects from exposure to misoprostol. If there is a delay \\nin a woman’s identification of the ongoing pregnancy and she \\nwants to terminate it, the increased gestational age may limit her \\naccess to abortion services. To review success rates for medical \\nabortion, please see Module 4: Informed Consent, Information and \\nCounseling. \\nWhen desired or needed, success can also be confirmed by a \\nprovider at a follow-up visit approximately two weeks after \\nmedical abortion. Confirmation is usually possible by reviewing \\na symptom history and conducting a pelvic examination. \\nPregnancy testing and/or ultrasound may be useful (if available \\nor by referral) if a woman is unsure about whether she passed \\nher pregnancy. Use of less resource-intensive aids in determining \\nsuccess of MA, such as symptom diaries and questionnaires, is an \\narea of ongoing research. In addition to confirming success, the \\nprovider can offer contraception if desired, address problems and \\nanswer remaining questions.\\nSteps to assess successful abortion\\n1.  Ask the woman whether she felt like she expelled the pregnancy. \\nDid she have heavy bleeding and cramping after she took \\nmisoprostol?  Did she pass tissue or clots?  \\n2.  Ask the woman if she ever felt pregnant, and if she still \\nfeels pregnant now. Review what pregnancy symptoms she \\nexperienced prior to and after the abortion.

For example, say “Tell me \\nhow and when you took each pill.”\\n4.  Perform a pelvic exam. Compare it to the exam documented \\nprior to the MA.\\n• If the woman had a pregnancy of up to 7 weeks gestation at \\nthe clinical assessment, the uterus should feel non-pregnant \\ntwo weeks after taking the MA medications.\\n• If the woman had a pregnancy of 8 weeks gestation or more, \\nthe uterus should be smaller two weeks after taking the MA \\nmedications. \\n5.  The abortion is most likely complete if the woman believes \\nshe had a successful abortion. Clinical indications that the \\nabortion is most likely complete are that the woman’s pregnancy \\nsymptoms have stopped, her bleeding pattern is normal and her \\nuterine size is non-pregnant or smaller than before.\\n6.  If there is any doubt, the provider can conduct or refer for \\nan ultrasound to look for a gestational sac or an ongoing \\npregnancy. \\nWhat to expect at a visit after MA\\nWhen women return for follow-up care or problem visits after MA, \\nclinicians commonly encounter the following scenarios:\\nNormal\\nThis is the most common outcome if the woman took the \\nmedicines as instructed. In general, her bleeding and cramping \\nmay have been significant for about a day following misoprostol \\nbut then diminished over the following week. By two weeks \\nafter taking the medications, cramping is usually gone, and \\napproximately 60 percent of women are still having light bleeding \\nor spotting (Davis 2000). Women who had pregnancy symptoms \\nprior to the MA should no longer have them by the time of a \\nfollow-up visit. \\nProblematic bleeding\\nSome women report tiresome or problematic bleeding at a follow-\\nup visit despite the fact that the pregnancy is not continuing, \\npregnancy symptoms have resolved and the uterus is smaller in \\nsize. These women should be offered additional treatment if it is \\nappropriate as described below. \\nVarious patterns of problematic bleeding are:\\nPersistent, heavy bleeding: This is when the woman bleeds as \\nmuch as a heavy menstrual period continuously since taking \\nmisoprostol.

If her \\nbleeding is currently not heavy but is somewhat prolonged or \\nerratic and she is clinically stable and feels well, a repeat dose \\nof misoprostol may be offered as long as the woman is willing to \\nreturn in one to three days for assessment.

Fluid intake (oral hydration) \\nand iron-rich foods or iron supplements should be strongly \\nencouraged.\\nErratic bleeding: Some women have days of very little or no \\nbleeding followed irregularly by heavy, gushing bleeding.

The woman should be treated according \\nto the severity of clinical presentation.\\nProblematic bleeding, along with continuing pregnancy, can \\nindicate that MA may not be successful and the woman may need \\nfurther treatment.

If a woman who has \\nan ectopic pregnancy receives MA, mifepristone and misoprostol \\nwill not treat the ectopic pregnancy. A woman with an early \\nectopic pregnancy may not have any symptoms. If she does have \\nsigns and symptoms, they may include:\\n• Minimal vaginal bleeding after taking medications for \\nabortion\\n• Uterine size that is smaller than expected\\n• Sudden, intense and persistent lower abdominal pain or \\ncramping, initially one-sided then generalized, that may be \\naccompanied by:\\n— Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting\\n— Palpable adnexal mass\\n• Fainting, shoulder pain, rapid heartbeat or lightheadedness \\n(from internal bleeding). Internal bleeding is not necessarily \\naccompanied by vaginal bleeding.\\nA ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a gynecologic emergency that can \\nbe life threatening and requires immediate surgical intervention. \\nA woman with suspected ectopic pregnancy should be treated \\nor transferred as soon as possible to a facility that can confirm \\ndiagnosis and begin treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment \\nof ectopic pregnancy save women’s lives and help preserve their \\nfertility.\\nComplications\\nHemorrhage\\nAcute hemorrhage requiring transfusion following MA is rare \\n(WHO 2000). In clinical trials of mifepristone and misoprostol, \\nthe risk of bleeding requiring transfusion ranges from 0.1% to \\n0.4% (Creinin & Gemzell-Danielsson 2009). With misoprostol-only \\nregimens, the rate of hemorrhage requiring transfusion is less \\nthan 1% (vonHertzen 2007). The range in rates reflects differences \\nin how studies defined heavy bleeding.\\nIndications that bleeding requires immediate attention are:\\n• Abundant gushing bleeding\\n• Bleeding like a heavy period that persists for weeks leading \\nto significant anemia and hypovolemia\\n• Pale appearance accompanied by weakness, agitation or \\ndisorientation'),\n",

Supportive therapy including intravenous \\nfluid and blood replacement and oxygen administration should \\nbe started. Vacuum aspiration is the first option treatment for \\nhemorrhage; this enables the uterus to contract and decrease \\nbleeding. \\nAlthough the efficacy has not been tested in women with \\nbleeding after medical abortion, therapies that may be given \\nfor bleeding or to stabilize a patient for transfer that have been \\nused after vacuum aspiration or postpartum hemorrhage include \\n(Lichtenberg & Grimes 2009, WHO 2009b):\\n• Vasopressin, 10 units in 20mL crystalloid injected \\ntranscervically into the myometrium\\n• Methylergonovine 0.2mg intramuscularly or intracervically\\n• Oxytocin 20 units in 1L IV at a rate of 60 drops per minute\\n• Misoprostol 200-800mcg orally, rectally or sublingually\\n• Intrauterine tamponade with sterile gauze packing or a 30-\\n75mL foley balloon\\nIf these measures appear necessary but are not available, refer the \\nwoman to a higher-resource site immediately.\\nInfection\\nMA is rarely associated with infection.

Only four of the 46,400 women (0.009%) in this \\nreview required hospitalization for infection. Prophylactic \\nantibiotics are not recommended for routine MA provision (WHO \\n2012, Achilles 2011).\\nA retrospective analysis of 227,823 medical abortions found \\na significant reduction in the rate of serious infection when \\nmisoprostol routing was changed to the buccal route instead \\nof the vaginal route.

Also used to describe the fertilization of the egg.\\nContraception/Contraceptive - Any behavior, device, medication or procedure used to prevent  \\npregnancy.\\nContractions - The muscle layers of the uterus tighten in a synchronous, rhythmic pattern. Contrac-\\ntions occur during medical abortion, miscarriage and childbirth,and after vacuum aspiration. These \\ncontractions aid in expulsion of the uterine contents, cause the uterus to shrink to pre-pregnant size, \\nand also clamp tightly around interwoven blood vessels, thereby preventing hemorrhage.\\nContraindications for MA - If a woman has these specific conditions, under no circumstances \\nshould she be offered MA. MVA should be considered or she should be referred to a facility where she \\ncan be offered alternate care.\\nDosage - Administration of a therapeutic agent in prescribed amounts.\\nEctopic Pregnancy - An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg attaches itself outside of the \\nuterus, most often in a fallopian tube.

Tubing is connected at one end to the electric pump, and at the other end is con-\\nnected to a cannula which is inserted through the cervix into the uterus.\\nEmergency Contraception (EC) - Hormonal medication used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected \\nvaginal intercourse. Must be started within 120 hours (five days) of intercourse, but is most effective \\nif used as early as possible after unprotected intercourse. Copper containing IUDs can also be used as \\nEC, if they are inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse.\\nFetus - Beyond 10 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, the pregnancy is called a fetus; be-\\nfore 10 weeks, it is referred to as an embryo.\\nFirst Trimester - The first three months of pregnancy.\\nFollow-up - The visit, phone call, or other mechanism through which a health-care provider confirms \\nthat the woman’s abortion was successful and in which her progress is checked and any needs are \\nmet.\\nGestational Age - This is the duration of pregnancy calculated from the first day of last menstrual \\ncycle. It is usually measured in weeks.\\nGestational Sac - A structure that develops in the uterus early in pregnancy; the first formation of an \\nembryonic structure. In an ultrasound, the gestational sac should be visible by five weeks of pregnan-\\ncy. In early pregnancy, the gestational sac is the first indication of an intrauterine pregnancy visible \\nby ultrasound. A yolk sac within the gestational sac confirms intrauterine pregnancy.\\nHydatidaform mole – An abnormal intrauterine growth of placental tissue that occurs after improp-\\ner fertilization. A molar pregnancy may be complete (no fetal tissue) or partial (abnormal fetal tissue) \\nbut is non-viable. Treatment includes removal and pathology review for definitive diagnosis. Fol-\\nlow-up is required to determine that gestational trophoblastic neoplasm or choriocarcinoma do not \\ndevelop.\\nHCG - A hormone normally produced during pregnancy. Can be tested for in urine or blood (serum \\nhCG).\\nHemorrhage - Heavy or excessive blood loss.\\nHome Administration - Self-administration of a drug or chemical outside of a clinical setting,  \\nusually in a woman’s home or another safe location. \\nHormonal Methods - Methods of birth control that use hormones to prevent pregnancy.

The IUD is a small device \\nmade of plastic, which may contain copper or a hormone, that is inserted into the uterus by a health-\\ncare provider to prevent pregnancy. \\nLMP - Last Menstrual Period; duration of pregnancy is calculated from the first day of last menstrual \\nperiod.\\nManual Vacuum Aspiration (MVA) - An in-clinic, early abortion procedure in which the uterus is \\nemptied with the gentle suction of a hand-held syringe.\\nMaternal Morbidity - Serious disease, disability or physical damage to women caused by pregnan-\\ncy-related complications.\\nMaternal Mortality - Deaths of women while they are pregnant or within 42 days of the end of a \\npregnancy (either an abortion or birth) caused by or related to the pregnancy or its management.\\nMedical Abortion - The use of one or more medications to end pregnancy. These medications termi-\\nnate the pregnancy, which is then expelled by the uterus in a process similar to miscarriage. Medical \\nabortion is sometimes called medication abortion, pharmacological abortion, pharmaceutical abor-\\ntion or the abortion pill. Medical abortion does not include emergency contraception (EC), also known \\nas the “morning-after pill,” which prevents pregnancy from occurring.\\nMifepristone - Originally known as RU-486, it blocks progesterone activity in the uterus, which  \\nstops the growth of the fetus and leads to detachment of the pregnancy. Additionally, it sensitizes the \\nuterus to prostaglandins, increasing the impact of misoprostol, and helps to soften the cervix.\\nMisoprostol - A prostaglandin analogue administered at varying intervals to soften the cervix,  \\nstimulate uterine contractions and cause expulsion of the pregnancy. \\nMissed Abortion - A failed early pregnancy in which the pregnancy is no longer developing but the \\ntissue has not been expelled from the uterus. A missed abortion may be managed expectantly, with \\nmisoprostol or with vacuum aspiration.\\nMultiple gestation - A pregnancy with more than one fetus such as twins, triplets or quadruplets.\\nPain Management - Using medications, psychological support and other means to decrease a  \\npatient’s reaction to pain. \\nPolicy - Includes statements, plans, practices and regulations adopted by a government or other orga-\\nnization that are designed to guide or control institutional and community behavior.\\nPostabortion Care (PAC) - Postabortion care refers to a specific set of services for women experi-\\nencing complications of spontaneous or induced abortion, including retained tissue, hemorrhage and \\ninfection. PAC consists of several elements: (1) Uterine evacuation with medications or vacuum aspi-\\nration (2) Counseling to identify and respond to women’s emotional and physical health needs and \\nother concerns; (3) Contraceptive information and method provision for women who desire to postpo-\\nneor limit future pregnancy; (4) Reproductive and other health services that are preferably provided \\non-site or via referrals to other accessible facilities in providers’ networks; and (5) Community and \\nservice provider partnerships to help prevent unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion and mobi-\\nlize resources to help women receive appropriate and timely care for complications of abortion.'),\n",

In summary, \\nEC is not abortion and it must be taken within a few days of unprotected sex to prevent a \\npregnancy, whereas MA is an abortion of an existing pregnancy.\\n• Who can provide MA?\\n Any trained clinician can provide MA as long as she or he can estimate gestational age, \\ndetermine if a woman is eligible and provide follow-up in case of an emergency. MA providers \\ndo not have to provide vacuum aspiration services, but must be able to manage or refer in the \\nunusual case of an MA failure in the rare case that a complication occurs. \\nEligibility\\n• Is MA safe and effective for adolescents?\\n Yes, MA is safe and effective in adolescents (Phelps 2001) and has been found to be even more \\neffective in women who have never given birth (see below).\\n• Is MA less effective for women who have never had children (nulliparous women)?\\n MA is effective in women of any parity, especially in nulliparous women. In a retrospective \\nstudy of MA up to 49 days, it was found that the success rate was higher for nulliparous \\nwomen than for those women who have previously given birth (parous women) (Lefebvre 2008, \\nChien 2009).\\n• Can the MA regimen using only misoprostol be used in obese women and if so, do you need to \\nincrease the dose? \\n A retrospective study showed that MA with mifepristone and misoprostol in obese women has \\nthe same efficacy rates as non-obese women and that no increased dose is needed (Strafford \\n2009). It is fair to assume that the dosage does not need to be changed with misoprostol-only \\nabortions, but there are no studies to confirm this.\\n• Are there any precautions for women who have had prior cesarean-sections when using MA \\nbefore 13 weeks?\\n No. Women with prior cesarean-sections (c-sections) are eligible for MA. One study of MA \\nup to 56 days since LMP found that women who had previous c-sections had higher failure \\nrates (Chien 2009). This study was conducted using the less effective oral route of 400µg of \\nmisoprostol. There is little data on safety of MA for women with prior c-sections before 13 \\nweeks, but a recent review of second-trimester abortion (up to 26 weeks) with misoprostol \\nfound the risk of uterine rupture to be less than 0.3 percent (similar to vaginal delivery after \\nc-section) (Goyal 2009), so one can assume that the risk of uterine rupture is far lower in \\nabortions before 13 weeks. MA can be recommended for women with prior c-sections at this \\ngestational age.'),\n",

A woman who \\nhas had an MA before may choose to have an MA again at any time if she is eligible. \\n• Do women need to have access to a telephone in order to use MA?\\n No. MA has been provided for women in communities where there are no phones at all; in \\nthese cases, a woman would be taken by vehicle to a medical facility if a serious problem \\narose.\\nPractical advice\\n• Does the mifepristone dose need to be repeated if a woman vomits?\\n If the woman has kept down the mifepristone for 30 minutes, she doesn’t need a repeat dose \\nof mifepristone. If she vomits within 30 minutes, she should be given a repeat mifepristone \\n200mg pill. If a woman is known to have a problem with frequent vomiting with pregnancy, to \\nprevent her from vomiting the mifepristone, it may be helpful to give an anti-emetic or a light \\nsnack (toast or crackers) to settle her stomach prior to giving mifepristone.\\n• What practical advice can help women preparing to have MA?\\n Giving women clear expectations about pain and bleeding are important when providing MA. \\nProviders report that women who are well-hydrated feel better and endure the side effects \\nof misoprostol better. Encourage women who are having MA to drink plenty of non-alcoholic \\nbeverages throughout the entire process. \\n• Is it necessary for a woman to have an adult stay with her on the day she takes misoprostol?\\n Having a friend, partner or family member in the home or close by on the day the woman \\ntakes misoprostol is ideal. However, some women prefer to be alone and do not want others \\nwith them after they take misoprostol or go through the process of expelling the pregnancy. \\nIf a woman is alone, it is highly recommended that she has access to a telephone if she needs \\nhelp—or at least has someone checking in on her throughout the day. \\n• Can women undergoing MA use tampons?\\n Once the heavier bleeding has subsided a day or two after using misoprostol, she may use \\ntampons. Basically, she can use tampons when she’s comfortable doing so, but during the day \\nshe uses misoprostol, it’s easier to assess the amount of bleeding if she does not use tampons.\\n• Can women undergoing MA take a bath?\\n Women can bathe during the MA, but should not insert the misoprostol vaginally while in the \\nbathtub.\\n• Should certain foods be avoided while using MA?\\n Any foods that the woman is comfortable eating and do not cause nausea or vomiting are safe \\nto eat while using MA and will not interfere with the medications.\\n• Is there a right or wrong place to insert the misoprostol vaginally?\\n The medication in misoprostol will be absorbed if it is placed anywhere in the vagina. After \\nplacing the pills in the vagina it is recommended that the woman lie down for 30 minutes so \\nthe pills do not fall out. See “Vaginal Use of Misoprostol” in Module Two A or Two B.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Medical-book.pdf'}, page_content='Ipas Medical Abortion Study Guide\\n96       Appendix C: Additional Medical Abortion Questions and Answers\\n• What if the woman inserts misoprostol vaginally, or buccally or sublingually and the pills don’t \\ndissolve?\\n Women need to be reassured that the active medicine within misoprostol will absorb within \\n30 minutes. The active ingredient of misoprostol will absorb from the pill through the mucus \\nmembrane of the vagina, cheek or under the tongue into the woman’s bloodstream. The outer \\nshell casing of the pill may not dissolve; that is not a problem. If the woman inserted the \\nmisoprostol vaginally, as long as the misoprostol has been in the vagina for 30 minutes, \\nthe active medicine has absorbed. If she gets up and urinates, for example, and the pill \\ncasings come out, she doesn’t need to put them back in the vagina. Similarly, if she places the \\nmisoprostol in the cheek (buccal) or under the tongue (sublingual), even if the pills haven’t \\ndissolved, the active medicine has absorbed, and she should swallow the remaining pill \\nfragments 30 minutes later. \\n• How much time does the woman need to rest after using misoprostol?\\n This will depend on the woman and her other responsibilities and any underlying medical \\nconditions (such as anemia). Typically, women can resume normal activities as early as the \\nday after using misoprostol, although she will likely be bleeding for several days or weeks. \\nShe should not engage in heavy physical activity (such as heavy lifting or vigorous exercise) \\nfor about a week after MA. \\n• Some women tell their family members that they are having a miscarriage, not an abortion. \\nWill the family members be able to tell the difference?\\n MA is basically a miscarriage induced with medicines. Unless a woman reveals that she’s \\ntaken medicines, family members or others will not be able to tell the difference between a \\nmiscarriage and a medical abortion. Women may want to consider that when the vaginal route \\nof administration is used, remnants of the medicines may remain. \\n• Can young women use MA?\\n MA is safe and effective in adolescents. It may even be slightly more effective in women who \\nhave not given birth before, which is the case for many young women. \\n• Is it possible for an adolescent or woman to just tell others that she is having a heavy period (so \\nthat family members won’t know she was pregnant)?\\n A woman who doesn’t want to tell her family that she is having a medical abortion may \\nexplain that she is having a heavy period. Some young women living with their families have \\nhad a medical abortion and told their families they are having a heavy menstrual period—if \\nthey say anything at all—so family members won’t know they were pregnant. They should be \\ncounseled, however, that their plan to keep the abortion and pregnancy secret may not work if \\nthey experience very heavy bleeding that requires emergency treatment, which is not common \\nbut can occur.\\n If bleeding is considerably heavier than a menstrual period, it may be difficult for a woman \\nto keep this from family members—particularly if she only has access to communal sanitary \\nfacilities. If someone notices the excessive bleeding, a married woman may still be able to say \\nshe is having an early miscarriage, but an adolescent or unmarried woman may wish—or even \\nneed, for her own safety—to avoid any acknowledgement of pregnancy. For this reason, women \\nshould be informed in advance of the possibility of heavy bleeding so they can plan accordingly.\\n• Can a woman use MA if she is pregnant with twins?\\n Yes. A woman who is pregnant with twins or other multiple gestations may take mifepristone \\nand misoprostol using the standard dosages of medications. The success rate is similar to the \\nsuccess rate for singleton pregnancies.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Medical-book.pdf'}, page_content='Ipas Medical Abortion Study Guide\\n  Appendix C: Additional Medical Abortion Questions and Answers     97\\nFollow-up\\n• Why is routine follow-up of MA no longer recommended?  \\n Routine follow-up is no longer recommended because the success of the mifepristone and \\nmisoprostol regimen is so high. Most women are able to determine whether their abortion \\nwas successful. However, routine follow-up may be offered if a woman wants reassurance \\nthat she has passed her pregnancy. Follow-up must be available for women who experience \\ncomplications or have a failed MA. For providers using misoprostol only, follow-up is \\nrecommended as the success rates are significantly lower. \\n• For those doing ultrasound at follow-up, what if an empty sac (not an ongoing pregnancy) is \\nseen at the follow-up visit?\\n If an empty gestational sac is seen on follow-up ultrasound, expectant management (waiting \\nand watching) can be used or an additional dose of misoprostol can be offered. A small study \\nof 800µg of misoprostol vaginally for MA up to 63 days since LMP found that more than half \\nof women expelled the gestational sac 1 week after the repeat dose of misoprostol (Reeves \\n2008). Women’s wishes to avoid surgery and instrumentation should be considered. Uterine \\naspiration may be necessary if the woman is symptomatic for bleeding problems.\\n• If the woman is still pregnant at the follow-up visit, can the dose of mifepristone and \\nmisoprostol be repeated?\\n If the woman is still pregnant at the follow-up visit, this is considered a MA failure and \\nstandard practice is to refer her for uterine aspiration. A repeat dose of misoprostol 1 week \\nafter the MA for ongoing pregnancies has been studied and found to have limited success \\n(about 30 percent) but is another option that can be considered to avoid uterine aspiration \\n(Reeves 2008). Repeating the entire regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol has not been \\nstudied and is not recommended.\\n• When will menstruation return after MA?\\n A study found that menses typically return about 33 days after MA (Davis 2000). \\n• Will clinicians receive a lot of after-hour phone calls when providing MA?\\n Clinicians receive fewer after-hours calls as they gain experience with MA. This is simply \\nbecause they learn how to communicate more clearly and effectively with women about what \\nto expect with the MA process. The amount of calls received after hours will depend on the \\nquality of the counseling and advance guidance given to women at the initial visit for MA. \\nWomen’s questions will lead providers to improve counseling by remembering to answer \\nthese concerns during subsequent clinic visits. \\n• What if a woman has an ongoing pregnancy at the follow-up visit and refuses to terminate the \\npregnancy?\\n Clinicians cannot force women to terminate a pregnancy, but should inform women of the \\npotential risk of birth defects should that pregnancy continue. At the initial visit, part of the \\ncounseling is to assess whether the woman is committed to the steps necessary to terminate \\nthe pregnancy, including vacuum aspiration if necessary. See “Potential Birth Defects” in \\nModule Four.\\n• What if clinicians observe repeated failures of MA?\\n The first step in evaluating what is perceived to be a high failure rate with MA is to determine \\nwhat the actual failure rate is over time and also to determine whether failure is truly due to \\nongoing pregnancy or if providers are intervening for other reasons.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Medical-book.pdf'}, page_content='Ipas Medical Abortion Study Guide\\n98       Appendix C: Additional Medical Abortion Questions and Answers\\n One type of failure occurs when the woman is no longer pregnant, but in the clinician’s \\njudgment, uterine evacuation is still advised. If this occurs frequently, a quality assurance \\nreview should be done to determine if these interventions were medically necessary. The \\nintervention rates of different providers (with ongoing pregnancy separated out) can be \\ncompared to see if there is wide variation in intervention rates, and then to determine why \\nthe intervention rate of one clinician is higher than the others. In a group of experienced \\nclinicians using a highly effective regimen, the intervention rate, not including intervention \\nfor ongoing pregnancy, is about 1 to 2 percent (Fjerstad 2009, Raghavan 2009). Clinicians who \\nare inexperienced with MA tend to intervene more at first because they are not confident in \\nthe method, not comfortable with the amount of time a woman may bleed after MA or simply \\nbecause they believe a uterine evacuation would resolve any potential problems. As clinicians \\ngain experience and confidence with MA, success rates rise and unnecessary interventions \\ndecrease (Borgatta 2000, Suhonen 2003). Basically, intervention is not needed as long as the \\nwoman feels well and does not have a viable (growing) pregnancy.\\n If it is determined that there is a higher-than-expected rate of ongoing pregnancy (which is \\na biologic outcome and is not dependent on clinician judgment or the possibility of over-\\nintervention), then a different analysis and response is needed. The ongoing pregnancies may \\nbe just coincidence, or it is possible that the batch of medicines is faulty or expired, or that \\nthe medicines were not taken properly. Review the expiration dates, the storage conditions \\nfor misoprostol and assure that the medicines were taken as directed and contact the \\nmanufacturer with any concerns. \\n Mifepristone is a very stable medicine with a long shelf life. There have been many anecdotal \\nreports about batches of misoprostol that resulted in high failure rates. Because misoprostol \\nis hygroscopic (that is, it attracts moisture), it can become ineffective if it remains in opened \\nbottles for a long time, especially in moist, humid or hot environments. Providers have \\nreported unexpected groups of failures; but when they used a new lot or a new bottle of \\nmisoprostol, failure rates returned to the usual low baseline rates. Misoprostol should always \\nbe stored in a cool dry area of the clinic. \\n• What are the psychological after-effects of MA?\\n The research on mental health after abortion is controversial as it is often politically \\nmotivated and prone to bias. In 2008, after extensive review of the evidence, the American \\nPsychological Association concluded that in general, women who terminate an unplanned, \\nundesired pregnancy are at no increased risk of mental health problems compared to other \\nwomen. Individual women, however, may be at greater risk of mental health problems \\nafterwards, particularly women who suffer from stigma, abuse, low social support, or pre-\\nexisting depression or anxiety. These women should be supported throughout and after their \\nabortion (Major et al 2009).'),\n",
